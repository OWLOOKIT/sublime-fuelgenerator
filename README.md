## sublime-fuelgenerator

A Sublime Text plugin that allows you to make use of the Fuel oil directly within Sublime Text.

## Installation

* Install the ST plugin through Package Control: *Sublime Fuel Generator* (soon)
* If you are on Windows or php executable is not in PATH, please specify the path to it in `fuelgenerator.sublime-settings`. To do so, copy `fuelgenerator.sublime-settings` from this
plugin to `<Packages_Directory>/Users/` and make the edits to that file.

## Usage

* Open a Fuel Project
* Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
* Execute any of the available Generate commands

*Note*: You could pass any of the oil options after the fields or the resource name if you cannot pass fields


## Customization

The plugin is quite extensible. Interested users can extend the plugin for more
oil commands by adding the appropriate entries in
`Default.sublime-commands`.
